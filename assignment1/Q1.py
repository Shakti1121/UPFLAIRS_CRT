# 1. Lists vs Tuples: Mutability and Performance
"""
Lists are mutable, meaning their elements can be changed, added, or removed.
Tuples are immutable, meaning they cannot be modified after creation.

Performance-wise, tuples are slightly faster than lists due to their fixed size.
Use lists when you need to modify data, and use tuples when you want immutable and faster data storage.
